product_id is the unique identifier for this table.
Each row contains information about a product including its name and category.
Write a solution to find the most popular product category for each season. The seasons are defined as:

Winter: December, January, February
Spring: March, April, May
Summer: June, July, August
Fall: September, October, November
The popularity of a category is determined by the total quantity sold in that season. If there is
a tie, select the category with the highest total revenue (quantity Ã— price).

Return the result table ordered by season in ascending order.
